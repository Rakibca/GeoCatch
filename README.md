## Description

A location-based photo game where you can challenge other users to try and locate where you took a photo. A second user must take a separate photo in that area and try to get as close as possible to the GeoCatch photo challenge original post.

- What was your motivation?

We felt as though many active applications were coming to life as the sedentary existence of phones and technologies could be overwhelming. A phenomenon such as Pokemon Go shows that there are many people who enjoy using their phones to be active. 

- Why did you build this project? 

We felt the need to push our full-stack skills and toolkit. Adding Mapbox, Chakra, and Turf to our list of skills felt especially challenging and enriching. 

- What problem does it solve?

This app tries to blend active phone use, physical activity, and photography passions into a gameified advenure photo game. A real-life Pokemon Snap, if you will.

- What did you learn?

We learned that React has plenty of single-page purpose, modals are useful, geospatial data and geojsons are super cool, and that we can apply our full-stack technologies and skills towards any project, so long as we appropriately plan for the complex logic and design standards.
